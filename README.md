# scrollNote

A Chrome extension that allows you to capture text selections along with screenshots and save them with personal notes to a cloud database.

## Features

- 📝 Select any text on a webpage and save it instantly
- 📸 Automatically captures screenshots of the current page
- 🗒️ Add personal notes to your saved selections
- ☁️ Cloud storage with Supabase backend
- 🔐 User authentication and personal data management
- 🌐 Web interface to view all your saved snaps
- 🔒 Secure backend architecture with protected API keys

## Project Architecture

The project consists of three main components:

1. **Chrome Extension**: Captures text selections and screenshots from web pages
2. **Website**: Displays saved snaps and manages user authentication
3. **Backend**: Securely handles API requests to Supabase for data storage and authentication

### Security Improvements

The original implementation had Supabase credentials exposed in the frontend code. The new architecture moves all Supabase interactions to a secure backend server, protecting the API keys and providing a more robust security model.

## Prerequisites

- Google Chrome browser
- Supabase account (free tier available)
- Node.js and npm installed
- Basic knowledge of Chrome extension installation

## Setup and Development

### Backend

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` and add your Supabase credentials.

4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

### Website

1. Update the `api-config.js` file with your backend URL.

2. Serve the website using a local server:
   ```
   npx serve website
   ```

### Extension

1. Update the `api-config.js` file with your backend URL.

2. Load the extension in Chrome:
   - Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode"
   - Click "Load unpacked" and select the `extension` directory

## Deployment

### Backend (Render)

1. Create a new Web Service on Render.
2. Connect your GitHub repository.
3. Configure the service:
   - Build Command: `npm install`
   - Start Command: `npm start`
   - Add environment variables from your `.env` file

### Website (Vercel)

1. Install Vercel CLI:
   ```
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. Deploy to Vercel:
   ```
   cd website
   vercel
   ```

3. Update the `api-config.js` file with your production backend URL.

### Extension (Chrome Web Store)

1. Update the `api-config.js` file with your production backend URL.

2. Create a ZIP file of the extension directory.

3. Upload to the Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard.

## How to Use

### First Time Setup

1. **Sign Up**: Click the scrollNote extension icon in Chrome and create an account. You will receive a email verification email on your email id from supabase.
2. **Sign In**: Use your credentials to sign in to the extension

### Capturing Snaps

1. **Select Text**: On any webpage, select the text you want to save
2. **Save Button**: A "Save" button will appear near your selection
3. **Click Save**: Click the button to start the capture process
4. **Add Note**: A popup will appear where you can add a personal note
5. **Save**: Click "Save" to store your snap in the cloud

### Viewing Your Snaps

1. Click the scrollNote extension icon
2. Click "View My Snaps" to open the web interface
3. Browse all your saved snaps with screenshots and notes

## Known Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Need to Sign In Every Time Browser Opens

**Problem**: Extension doesn't remember login state after browser restart.

**Current Workaround**: 
- Sign in each time you open the browser
- The extension uses `chrome.storage.local` which should persist, but may need debugging

### Issue 2: Need to Click Extension Icon for Screenshot Permission

**Problem**: Chrome requires explicit permission for screenshot capture everytime you try to save your note.

**Current Workaround**: 
- Click the extension icon once per browser session to grant screenshot permission
- This activates the `activeTab` permission needed for screenshots

## Key Technlogies

- Chrome Extensions API (Manifest V3)
- Supabase (Database + Authentication + Storage)
- Frontend (HTML + CSS + Vanilla JavaScript)

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Working
1. Check if the extension is enabled in `chrome://extensions/`
2. Verify Supabase configuration is correct
3. Check browser console for error messages

### Screenshots Not Saving
1. Click the extension icon to activate permissions
2. Verify the storage bucket is public in Supabase
3. Check network connectivity

### Authentication Issues
1. Verify Supabase project is active
2. Check if email confirmation is required
3. Ensure RLS policies are correctly set up
